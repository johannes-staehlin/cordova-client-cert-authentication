# cordova-client-cert-authentication
This plugin adds certificate-based authentication (SSO) to your cordova application. There is no extra coding or android  knowledge required when using this plugin. It does not contain any JavaScript part since it just waits until the SSLSocket asks the client for a certificate and then shows the default client-cert pop-up you would also get when visiting your web page using the android chrome browser.

## Usage
Follow the official [Get Started](https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted) guide of cordova or use your existing application.

Add the following plugin to your `config.xml`
```xml
<plugin name="cordova-client-cert-authentication" version="1" />
```

Then run your usual commands:
```bash
cordova platform add android
cordova build
...
```

## Why is there no support for iOS?
That's not easy to answer - the main point is, that iOS handles client certificates in a different way than Android. [This comment](https://github.com/johannes-staehlin/cordova-client-cert-authentication/issues/5#issuecomment-424494990) provides a good summary:

> On Android the user can download and install a standard certificate on the device, then use the standard selection mechanism to select the certificate needed to access a server. On iOS this is not really possible.
> 
> On iOS, the application has to open the certificate file and configure or store it somehow. But I think the certificate file cannot have the standard p12 extension since iOS has its own handler for that extension. And it may be necessary for the iOS app to handle user password very carefully, meaning never store user password itself.

This means, Android applications can "ask for access" to the main KeyStore of the OS, while on iOS the certificate has to be  "imported into keychain of the app" in any way, thus a custom implementation is needed (please **never** ship the client certificate with the app in the assert folder).
Therefore, I am not sure if a common cordova plugin even makes sense - but if someone comes up with a good PR, I am open to merge it.
See [#5](https://github.com/johannes-staehlin/cordova-client-cert-authentication/issues/5) for the full discussion.
